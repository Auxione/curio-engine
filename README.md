# Curio-engine
Curio engine is currently in an alpha state. This means that there are likely to be bugs and the code I push will probably break past versions. 
With that said if you still would like to help develop or use the engine feel free to do so and post bug reports. 
Curio Engine is a learning project based on various tutorials on internet.
